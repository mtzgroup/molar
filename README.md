MolAR has 2 components:
- iOS app
- web server: mediates between the iOS app and cloud services

## Web server

Requirements: Python, pip, Mathpix account, AWS account (for Amazon Rekognition), Google Cloud account (for Google Cloud Vision API), and TeraChem Cloud account.

1. `cd server`
1. `pip install httpx boto3 google-cloud-vision tccloud fastapi uvicorn`
1. To use the chemical structure recognition feature, create a [Mathpix](https://mathpix.com) account and set the following environment variables:
   - `MATHPIX_APP_ID`
   - `MATHPIX_APP_KEY`
1. To use the object recognition feature, follow the instructions on [Getting started with Amazon Rekognition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/getting-started.html), then set the following environment variables:
   - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
   - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

    Then follow the instructions on [Google Cloud: Setup the Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/setup), and put service-account-file.json in the current folder.
1. To use the quantum computation feature, contact the [Martinez group](https://mtzweb.stanford.edu) to get a TeraChem Cloud account. Then set the following environment variables:
   - `TCCLOUD_USER`
   - `TCCLOUD_PWD`
1. `uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080`

## iOS app

Requirements: macOS Big Sur or later, Xcode 12 or later.

1. `cd ios/MolAR`
1. `cp Config.swift.example Config.swift`
1. Edit Config.swift, set the web server address. Then save.
1. Open the project in Xcode and run.
